# Project 2: FootWearhouse

## Description

Welcome to a great way to buy, sell, or even trade shoes.  This website allows you to create a simple profile where you can log in and interact with other users to buy, sell, or even trade your shoes.  It's like a social media platform for shoes.  Skip the fees from sites like Stockx and eBay and go directly to the source just like at a shoe convention, but even better because our site is open 24/7 for all of your shoe needs.
